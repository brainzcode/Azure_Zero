# Azure Authentication Methods:

Authentication is the process of establishing the identity of a person, service, or device by providing credentials. Azure offers various authentication methods, including:

- **Standard Passwords:** Traditional method requiring a username and password for authentication.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Allows users to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials.
- **Multifactor Authentication (MFA):** Adds an extra layer of security by requiring additional verification beyond just a password.
- **Passwordless:** Authentication methods that do not rely on passwords, enhancing security and convenience.

In the past, security and convenience were often seen as conflicting goals, but newer authentication solutions aim to provide both.

## Single sign-on (SSO)

**Overview:**
Single sign-on (SSO) enables a user to sign in one time and use that credential to access multiple resources and applications from different providers. For SSO to work, the different applications and providers must trust the initial authenticator.

**Challenges with Multiple Identities:**
- Managing multiple identities leads to an increase in passwords to remember and change.
- Password policies varying among applications make it difficult for users to manage.
- Increased complexity raises the risk of credential-related security incidents.
- Managing numerous identities puts a strain on help desks dealing with account lockouts and password reset requests.
- Tracking down and disabling all identities when a user leaves an organization can be challenging and may lead to overlooked access.

**Benefits of SSO:**
- Requires remembering only one ID and password, simplifying the user experience.
- Grants access across applications to a single identity, reducing the effort needed to manage accounts.
- Ties access to a single identity, facilitating easier management of user access during role changes or departures.
- Enhances security and convenience for both users and IT departments.

- ### NOTE:
  - **Single sign-on is only as secure as the initial authenticator because the subsequent connections are all based on the security of the initial authenticator.**

## Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

**Overview:**
Multifactor authentication (MFA) is the process of prompting a user for an extra form (or factor) of identification during the sign-in process. It enhances security by requiring two or more elements to authenticate, reducing the impact of credential exposure.

**Elements of Multifactor Authentication:**
1. **Something the user knows:** This could be a challenge question.
2. **Something the user has:** This might involve a code sent to the user's mobile phone.
3. **Something the user is:** This typically involves a biometric property like a fingerprint or face scan.

**Enhanced Security:**
- MFA helps protect against password compromises by requiring additional authentication factors.
- It limits the impact of credential exposure, as an attacker would need more than just a password to authenticate.
- Compared to single-factor authentication, MFA significantly improves security by adding extra layers of verification.

**Recommendation:**
Enable multifactor authentication wherever possible to enhance security and mitigate the risks associated with credential-based attacks.
