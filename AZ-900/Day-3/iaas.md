## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

- ### Flexibility:
  - Most flexible category of cloud services

- ### Control Level:
  - Provides maximum control over cloud resources

- ### Responsibilities:
  - Cloud provider handles hardware, network connectivity, and physical security.

  - User responsible for operating system, network configuration, database, storage, etc.

- ### Analogy:
  - Renting hardware in a cloud datacenter, with user determining usage and configurations.

## Shared Responsibility Model in Cloud Services

- **Applicability:**
  - Applies to all cloud service types.

- **IaaS Responsibilities:**
  - IaaS places the largest share of responsibility on the user.
  
  - Cloud provider handles physical infrastructure and internet access.

  - User responsible for installation, configuration, patching, updates, and security.

## Scenarios
- ### Some common scenarios where IaaS might make sense include:

  - **Lift-and-shift migration:** Youâ€™re standing up cloud resources similar to your on-prem datacenter, and then simply moving the things running on-prem to running on the IaaS infrastructure.

  - **Testing and development:** You have established configurations for development and test environments that you need to rapidly replicate. You can stand up or shut down the different environments rapidly with an IaaS structure, while maintaining complete control.
