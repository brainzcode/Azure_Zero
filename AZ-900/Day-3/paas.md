## Platform as a Service (PaaS)

- **Position in Cloud Service Spectrum:**
  - Middle ground between IaaS and SaaS.

- **Provider Responsibilities:**
  - Maintains physical infrastructure, security, and internet connection

  - Handles operating systems, middleware, development tools, and business intelligence services.

- **User Benefits:**
  - No concerns about licensing or patching for operating systems and databases.

- **Development Environment:**
  - Well-suited for providing a complete development environment.
  
  - Relieves users of the maintenance burden associated with development infrastructure.


## Shared Responsibility Model in Cloud Services

- **Applicability:**
  - Applies to all cloud service types.

- **PaaS Responsibilities:**
  - Splits responsibility between user and cloud provider.
  
  - Cloud provider handles physical infrastructure, internet access, operating systems, databases, and development tools.

  - Resembles using a domain-joined machine: IT maintains device with updates, patches, and refreshes.

- **Additional Responsibilities:**
  - Depending on configuration, user or cloud provider may be responsible for networking settings, connectivity, network and application security, and directory infrastructure.


## Scenarios
- ### Some common scenarios where PaaS might make sense include:

    - **Development framework:** PaaS provides a framework that developers can build upon to develop or customize cloud-based applications. Similar to the way you create an Excel macro, PaaS lets developers create applications using built-in software components. Cloud features such as scalability, high-availability, and multi-tenant capability are included, reducing the amount of coding that developers must do.
  
    - **Analytics or business intelligence:** Tools provided as a service with PaaS allow organizations to analyze and mine their data, finding insights and patterns and predicting outcomes to improve forecasting, product design decisions, investment returns, and other business decisions.
