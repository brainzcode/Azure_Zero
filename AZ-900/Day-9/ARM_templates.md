# Azure Resource Manager (ARM) and ARM Templates

- **Azure Resource Manager (ARM):**
  - Deployment and management service for Azure.
  - Facilitates creating, updating, and deleting resources in Azure.
  - Handles requests from various Azure tools, APIs, or SDKs.
  - Provides consistent results and capabilities through a unified API.

- **ARM Templates:**
  - Templates used to define the infrastructure and configuration of Azure resources.
  - Written in JSON format.
  - Enable declarative provisioning and automation of Azure resource deployments.

## Azure Resource Manager Benefits

- **Declarative Management:**
  - Infrastructure managed through JSON-based templates, ensuring consistency.

- **Group Management:**
  - Allows managing, deploying, and monitoring resources as a single unit.

- **Consistent Deployment:**
  - Ensures consistent deployment across different stages of development.

- **Dependency Management:**
  - Defines dependencies between resources for correct deployment order.

- **Access Control:**
  - Native integration with RBAC for applying access control to all services.

- **Resource Organization:**
  - Enables tagging to logically organize resources within subscriptions.

- **Billing Clarity:**
  - Facilitates viewing costs for groups of resources sharing the same tag for billing clarity.


## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- **Concept:**
  - Manage infrastructure through code, starting with basic tools like Azure Cloud Shell, PowerShell, or CLI.

- **Progression:**
  - Evolves to managing entire deployments using repeatable templates and configurations.

- **Examples:**
  - **ARM Templates:** Declarative JSON files defining resources and configurations.
  - **Bicep:** Domain-specific language that simplifies ARM template creation and management.

## ARM Templates

- **Description:**
  - Declarative JSON format to describe desired resources and configurations.

- **Verification:**
  - Deployment code is verified before execution, ensuring correct resource creation and connections.

- **Orchestration:**
  - Resources are created in parallel, enabling simultaneous creation of multiple instances.

- **Simplicity:**
  - Developers, DevOps, or IT professionals define resource states and configurations; template handles the rest.

- **Script Execution:**
  - Templates can execute scripts (PowerShell/Bash) before or after resource setup.

## ARM Template Benefits

- **Declarative Syntax:**
  - Define infrastructure without writing deployment commands.

- **Repeatable Results:**
  - Consistently deploy infrastructure across multiple environments.

- **Orchestration:**
  - Automate deployment sequence and parallel resource creation.

- **Modular Files:**
  - Break templates into reusable components and nest them for complex deployments.

- **Extensibility:**
  - Incorporate PowerShell/Bash scripts for additional setup flexibility.

## Bicep

- **Support for all resource types and API versions:**
  - Immediate support for all Azure service versions.
  
- **Simple syntax:**
  - Concise and readable, requiring no previous programming knowledge.
  
- **Repeatable results:**
  - Idempotent deployment ensures consistent infrastructure state.
  
- **Orchestration:**
  - Resource Manager manages deployment complexities, including parallel deployments.
  
- **Modularity:**
  - Break code into reusable modules for easier management and development.
