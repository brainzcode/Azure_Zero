# Benefits of reliability and predictability in the cloud.

- ### Reliability and predictability are two crucial cloud benefits that help you develop solutions with confidence.

## Reliability.
- **System Ability:** Ability to recover from failures and maintain functionality.

- **Well-Architected Framework:** Integral pillar in the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework.

## Cloud Design Impact
- **Decentralized Design:** Inherent in cloud infrastructure.

- **Global Scale:** Resources deployed globally enhance reliability.

## Resilience through Global Scale.
- ### Catastrophic Event Response:
  - Cloud's decentralized design ensures other regions remain functional during a catastrophic event.

- ### Automated Reliability
  - Applications can be designed to automatically leverage global scale for increased reliability.


## Predictability.
- **Confidence Boost:**
  - Allows moving forward with confidence in cloud operations.

### Two Key Aspects

- #### Performance Predictability
  - Assurance of consistent performance.

- #### Cost Predictability
  - Assurance of consistent and manageable costs.

### Influence of Well-Architected Framework

- #### Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework
  - Significantly impacts both performance and cost predictability.

- #### Framework Deployment
  - Solutions built around this framework result in predictable costs and performance.

## Performance Predictability

- ### Focus:
  - Predicting resources needed for a positive customer experience.

- ### Supported by Cloud Concepts:
  - **Autoscaling**:
    - Deploys additional resources to meet sudden demand.

    - Scales back when demand decreases.

  - **Load Balancing**:
    - Redirects traffic from overloaded areas to less stressed areas.

  - **High Availability**:
    - Ensures consistent performance even during unexpected events.


## Cost Predictability

- ### Focus:
  - Predicting or forecasting the cost of cloud spend.

- ### Cloud Advantages:
  - Real-time tracking of resource use.

  - Monitoring resources for efficient utilization.

  - Applying data analytics for pattern and trend identification.

- ### Operational Benefits:
  - Predicting future costs with cloud analytics.

  - Adjusting resources as needed based on predictions.


- ### Tools Utilization:
  - **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and Pricing Calculator:**
    - Provides estimates for potential cloud spend
