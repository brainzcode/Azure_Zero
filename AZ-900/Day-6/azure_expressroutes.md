# Azure ExpressRoute:

- Azure ExpressRoute facilitates extending on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud via a private connection.
- This connection, known as an ExpressRoute Circuit, is established with the assistance of a connectivity provider.
- ExpressRoute enables connections to Microsoft cloud services like Azure and Microsoft 365, linking offices, datacenters, or other facilities to the Microsoft cloud.
- Each location typically has its own ExpressRoute circuit.
- Connectivity options include any-to-any (IP VPN), point-to-point Ethernet, or virtual cross-connection through a connectivity provider at a colocation facility.
- ExpressRoute connections bypass the public Internet, offering enhanced reliability, faster speeds, consistent latencies, and higher security compared to typical Internet connections.

## Features and benefits of ExpressRoute
- **There are several benefits to using ExpressRoute as the connection service between Azure and on-premises networks.**

    - Connectivity to Microsoft cloud services across all regions in the geopolitical region.
    - Global connectivity to Microsoft services across all regions with the ExpressRoute Global Reach.
    - Dynamic routing between your network and Microsoft via Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
    - Built-in redundancy in every peering location for higher reliability.

    ### Connectivity to Microsoft cloud services
    - **ExpressRoute enables direct access to the following services in all regions:**

        - Microsoft Office 365
        - Microsoft Dynamics 365
        - Azure compute services, such as Azure Virtual Machines
        - Azure cloud services, such as Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Storage

    ### Global Connectivity.
    - ExpressRoute Global Reach enables the exchange of data across on-premises sites by connecting ExpressRoute circuits.
    - For instance, if you have offices or datacenters in different regions with separate ExpressRoute circuits, you can use ExpressRoute Global Reach to connect them.
    - This facilitates communication between facilities without data transfer over the public internet.

    ### Dynamic routing
    - ExpressRoute uses the BGP. BGP is used to exchange routes between on-premises networks and resources running in Azure. This protocol enables dynamic routing between your on-premises network and services running in the Microsoft cloud. 
    
    ### Built-in redundancy
    - Each connectivity provider uses redundant devices to ensure that connections established with Microsoft are highly available. You can configure multiple circuits to complement this feature.
    
    ### ExpressRoute connectivity models
    - ExpressRoute supports four models that you can use to connect your on-premises network to the Microsoft cloud:

        - CloudExchange colocation
        - Point-to-point Ethernet connection
        - Any-to-any connection
        - Directly from ExpressRoute sites

        #### Co-location at a cloud exchange
        - Co-location at a cloud exchange
        Co-location refers to your datacenter, office, or other facility being physically co-located at a cloud exchange, such as an ISP. If your facility is co-located at a cloud exchange, you can request a virtual cross-connect to the Microsoft cloud.

    
        #### Point-to-point Ethernet connection
        - Point-to-point ethernet connection refers to using a point-to-point connection to connect your facility to the Microsoft cloud.

    
        #### Any-to-any networks
        - With any-to-any connectivity, you can integrate your wide area network (WAN) with Azure by providing connections to your offices and datacenters. Azure integrates with your WAN connection to provide a connection like you would have between your datacenter and any branch offices.

    
        #### Directly from ExpressRoute sites
        - You can connect directly into the Microsoft's global network at a peering location strategically distributed across the world. ExpressRoute Direct provides dual 100 Gbps or 10-Gbps connectivity, which supports Active/Active connectivity at scale.

    
        #### Co-location at a cloud exchange
        - Co-location at a cloud exchange
        Co-location refers to your datacenter, office, or other facility being physically co-located at a cloud exchange, such as an ISP. If your facility is co-located at a cloud exchange, you can request a virtual cross-connect to the Microsoft cloud.


        #### Security Benefits of ExpressRoute:

      - ExpressRoute provides a private connection from on-premises infrastructure to Azure, eliminating exposure to risks associated with internet communications.
      - Data transferred via ExpressRoute does not travel over the public internet, enhancing security.
      - However, certain operations like DNS queries, certificate revocation list checking, and Azure Content Delivery Network requests still traverse the public internet even with an ExpressRoute connection.
