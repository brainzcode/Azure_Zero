# Azure Costs

- **Azure shifts development costs from the capital expense (CapEx) of building out and maintaining infrastructure and facilities to an operational expense (OpEx) of renting infrastructure as you need it, whether itâ€™s compute, storage, networking, and so on.**

    - That OpEx cost can be impacted by many factors. Some of the impacting factors are:

        - Resource type
        - Consumption
        - Maintenance
        - Geography
        - Subscription type
        - Azure Marketplace

## Factors Affecting Azure Resource Costs:

- ### Resource Type:
  - Various factors impact the cost of Azure resources, including resource type, settings, and region.
  - Metered instances are created for each provisioned resource to track usage and generate usage records for billing.

  - **Examples:**
    - **Storage Account:** Factors such as type (e.g., blob), performance tier, access tier, redundancy settings, and region influence costs.
    - **Virtual Machine (VM):** Considerations include OS/software licensing, processor/cores, attached storage, and network interface.


## Consumption:

- ### Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG):*
  - Under the PAYG model, you pay for the resources you consume during a billing cycle.
  - Flexibility is a key feature, as usage fluctuations result in corresponding billing adjustments.

- ### Reserved Capacity:
  - Azure offers the option to commit to a predetermined amount of cloud resources in advance.
  - By reserving capacity, users can receive discounts on their resource usage, sometimes up to 72%.
  - This model requires a commitment to using and paying for a specific amount of Azure resources over a defined period (typically one or three years).
  - It provides significant savings for stable workloads while allowing flexibility to accommodate sudden demand surges beyond the reserved capacity.
