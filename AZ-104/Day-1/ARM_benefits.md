## Why Use ARM?

- **Consistency:** Deploy the same configuration to different environments (test, production) repeatedly, reducing errors.
- **Organization:** Group related resources, apply access controls (RBAC), and track billing via tags.
- **Automation:** Use declarative templates ("Infrastructure as Code") to define your setup rather than manual steps.

## How to Access ARM

- Choose the tools that work for you: Azure Portal, PowerShell, CLI, REST API, or SDKs. They all interact with the same underlying ARM service.

## Best Practices

- **Embrace Templates:** Define your entire infrastructure in templates for easy replication.
- **No Manual Steps:** Everything should be in the template for full automation.
- **Use Resource Groups:** Group things that share a lifecycle (deploy/delete them together).
- **Tag for Organization:** Use tags flexibly beyond just resource groups for billing and management insights.
