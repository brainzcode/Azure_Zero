# Methods for Adding Cloud Identity User Accounts

* **Azure Portal:** The most common way, using the "Create a user" or "Invite a guest user" options.
* **Other Admin Centers:** Accounts can also be added through the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, Microsoft Intune admin console, and the Azure CLI (command-line interface).

**Key Information about Cloud Identity Accounts**

* **Display Name vs. Account Name:** The display name is how the user is represented (e.g., Aran Sawyer-Miller), while the account name is their login identifier (e.g., [email address removed]).
* **User Profile Data:** Includes job title, contact details, etc. Some data can be pre-set by admins, while non-admins may have limited control over their profile.

**Things to Consider When Managing Accounts**

* **Profile Customization:** Determine how much control users have over their own profile information.
* **Deleted Account Recovery:** Deleted accounts can be restored for up to 30 days. Plan for potential recovery scenarios.
* **Data Collection:** Utilize sign-in and audit logs gathered by Microsoft Entra ID to analyze and improve your user management processes and security.
