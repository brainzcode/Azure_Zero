# Azure Bicep: Simplifying Resource Deployment

## What is Bicep?

- **Domain-Specific Language (DSL):** A language designed specifically to deploy Azure resources.
- **Declarative Syntax:** Focus on _what_ to deploy, not the step-by-step process.
- **Alternative to JSON:** Offers a cleaner way to write Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates.

## How does Bicep Work?

- **Transpilation:** Bicep code is converted into standard ARM template JSON before deployment.
- **No Loss of Functionality:** You don't lose any of ARM's capabilities.

## Key Advantages of Bicep

- **Simpler Syntax:** Less complex code, direct referencing of resources/properties.
- **Modules:** Break large deployments into reusable chunks.
- **Automatic Dependency Management:** Easier to manage how resources relate to each other.
- **Type Validation & IntelliSense:** Better authoring experience in tools like VS Code.
