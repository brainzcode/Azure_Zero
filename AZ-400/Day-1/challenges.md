# Challenges Facing DevOps Transformation Teams

- **Staff Availability:** Transformation team members being pulled into day-to-day operations, impacting their ability to focus on long-term transformation goals. Customer-impacting issues will always take priority.
- **Organizational Conflicts:** Existing processes and procedures may not be compatible with the changes a DevOps transformation requires.
- **Transforming in Place is Difficult:** Research shows successful innovation often happens _outside_ existing organizational structures.

## Solution: Separate Transformation Teams

- Create a dedicated transformation team, freed from daily operational responsibilities.
- Members should be well-regarded within the organization and possess a broad, innovative skillset.
- Consider including external experts to provide specialized knowledge and guide the transition to new processes.
