# What is DevOps?

DevOps aims to eliminate silos between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams. It encourages collaboration, shared practices, and tools to streamline software development. Key practices in DevOps include:

- **Agile planning:** Flexible approach to project management.
- **Continuous Integration:** Merging code frequently to detect problems early.
- **Continuous Delivery:** Deploying reliable software releases quickly and consistently.
- **Monitoring:** Tracking application performance for optimization.

## DevOps as a Journey

**DevOps is an ongoing process. Here's how to optimize it:**

1. **Understand Cycle Time:** Measure the time it takes to go from idea to deployment.
2. **Use Data:** Make decisions based on real-world usage data.
3. **Validate Learning:** Use feedback to quickly identify valuable changes and discard ineffective ones.
4. **Shorten Cycle Time:** Smaller changes, automation, improved processes, and frequent deployments accelerate feedback loops.
5. **Optimize Learning** Increased experimentation leads to faster validated learning and ultimately better business outcomes.
