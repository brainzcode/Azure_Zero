# Managing Work with GitHub Project Boards

GitHub Project boards help you manage project deliverables, release dates, and iterations effectively.

## Creating and Managing Iterations

**Purpose of Iterations:**
- Associate items with specific repeating blocks of time.
- Set iterations to any length of time, including breaks.
- Configure projects to group by iteration to visualize upcoming work balance.

**Creating an Iteration Field:**
1. Use the command palette:
   - Press `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux) or `Command+K` (Mac).
   - Start typing "Create new field" and select it.
2. Using the project interface:
   - Navigate to your project.
   - Click the plus (+) sign in the rightmost field header.
   - Select "New field", name the iteration field, choose "Iteration" from the dropdown, and set the start date and duration.
   - Click "Save and create".

## Adding New Iterations

1. Navigate to your project.
2. Open the menu in the top-right corner and click "Settings".
3. Select the iteration field to adjust.
4. Click "Add iteration", set the start date and duration, then click "Save changes".

## Inserting Breaks
- You can insert breaks into iterations to indicate time away from scheduled work.

For detailed guidance, refer to GitHub Docs on managing iterations and best practices for managing projects.
