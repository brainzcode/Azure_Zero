# Challenges of Agile Transformation

* Traditional organizations often have rigid structures and processes that impede agility. This resistance to change and centralized decision-making hinders their ability to adapt to rapidly evolving market conditions.

**Horizontal vs. Vertical Team Structures**

* **Horizontal Teams:** Organized around layers of software architecture (e.g., user interface, service layer, data layer). This can create dependencies and slow down delivery.
* **Vertical Teams:** Cross-functional teams aligned with specific products or features. Each team has the necessary skills to deliver value independently. These teams promote:
    * **Better outcomes:** Focus on delivering complete features rather than components.
    * **Ownership:** Each product/feature has a clear owner.
    * **Scalability:**  Adding more vertical teams allows organizations to scale their Agile efforts effectively.

**Key Takeaway**

Vertical team structures are generally more conducive to successful Agile practices within organizations. They promote better outcomes, clear ownership, and greater scalability.
