# Project Boards
Project boards allow you to manage and visualize work through issues, pull requests, and notes organized into customizable columns. They support different levels of scope:
- **User-owned**: Includes issues and pull requests from any personal repository.
- **Organization-wide**: Includes issues and pull requests from any repository within an organization.
- **Repository-specific**: Limited to a single repository's issues and pull requests.

To create a board for an organization, you must be a member of that organization. Templates are available to set up project boards with predefined columns and automation options, such as:
- **Basic Kanban**: "To do," "In progress," and "Done" columns.
- **Automated Kanban**: Cards automatically move between columns.
- **Automated Kanban with Review**: Adds triggers for pull request review status.
- **Bug Triage**: "To do," "High priority," "Low priority," and "Closed" columns.

### Projects
Projects are a more flexible and customizable tool, functioning like a spreadsheet to plan and track work. You can filter, sort, group issues and pull requests, and add custom fields for metadata tracking. Available views include Board and Table formats. Custom fields can track various aspects, such as:
- Target ship dates (date field)
- Task complexity (number field)
- Task priority (single select field)
- Quick notes (text field)
- Work planning by week, including breaks (iteration field)

Changes to pull requests or issues are automatically reflected in the project. For more information on creating, managing, and automating projects, GitHub provides detailed guides.
