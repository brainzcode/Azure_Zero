# Agile Development Practices

## Traditional Software Development: Waterfall

* **Sequential process:** Problem identification -> Requirements -> Build/Test -> Delivery
* **Drawbacks:**
    * Inflexible to changing customer needs
    * Requirements can be inaccurate, leading to mismatched final products

**Agile Methodology**

* **Iterative Approach:** Emphasizes adaptation, early delivery, and continuous improvement.
* **Agile Manifesto (2001):**
    * Prioritizes individuals/interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responsiveness to change.  
* **Releases and Iterations:**
    * Releases contain multiple iterations (like mini-projects)
    * Each iteration delivers tested working code
    * Focus on outcomes and avoiding over-engineering 

**Waterfall vs. Agile**

| Feature | Waterfall | Agile |
|---|---|---|
| Structure | Distinct phases | Iterative sprints |
| Flexibility | Rigid | Adaptable |
| Scope | Defined upfront | Evolves with project |
| Focus | Project completion | Customer satisfaction |

**Key Benefits of Agile**

* Adapts to evolving customer requirements
* Delivers working software incrementally
* Encourages continuous improvement and prevents wasted effort
