# Select tools and processes for agile practices


While developing agile methods does not require specific tooling, tools can often enhance the achieved outcomes.

It is essential to realize that the vital tool for agile development is the process itself.

Become familiar with the procedures you need to follow before working out how to implement tools. Several categories of tools are commonly used.

## Physical tools

Not all tools need to be digital tools. Many teams use whiteboards to collaborate on ideas, index cards for recording stories, and sticky notes for moving around tasks.

Even when digital tools are available, it might be more convenient to use these physical tools during stand-up and other meetings.

## Collaboration tools

We described collaboration tools in the previous topic.

## Project management tools

These tools usually include:

- Project planning and execution monitoring abilities (including how to respond to impediments).
- Automation for stand-up meetings.
- Management and tracking of releases.
- A way to record and work with the outcomes of retrospectives.
- Many include Kanban boards and detailed sprint planning options.

These tools will also provide detailed visualizations, often as a graphic dashboard that shows team progress against assigned goals and targets.

Some tools integrate directly with code repositories and CI/CD tools and add code-related metrics, including quality metrics and direct support for code reviews.

As a complete CI/CD system, we have Azure DevOps and GitHub that includes:

- Flexibility in Kanban boards.
- Traceability through Backlogs.
- Customizability in dashboards.
- Built-in scrum boards.
- Integrability directly with code repositories.
- Code changes can be linked directly to tasks or bugs.

Apart from Azure DevOps and GitHub, other standard tools include:

- Jira.
- Trello.
- Active Collab.
- Agilo for Scrum.
- SpiraTeam.
- Icescrum.
- SprintGround.
- Gravity.
- Taiga.
- VersionOne.
- Agilean.
- Wrike.
- Axosoft.
- Assembla.
- PlanBox.
- Asana.
- Binfire.
- Proggio.
- VivifyScrum, and many others.

## Screen recording tools

It might seem odd to add screen recording tools to this list. Still, they are beneficial when:

- Work with remote team members.
- Recording bugs in action.
- Building walkthroughs and tutorials that demonstrate actual or potential features.

A screen recorder is built into Windows, but other common ones include SnagIt, Camtasia, OBS, and Loom.
