# Key Factors to Consider

* **DevOps Maturity:** Where are you in your implementation? Draft architecture provides insights into resource requirements (e.g., parallel pipelines).
* **Usage:** 
     * How many users will need access to different features?
     * What are your build queue tolerance levels? Do you need paid parallel jobs for faster builds?
* **User Roles:**  Should everyone have access to all features? Differentiate between Stakeholders, Basic users, and those who might already have Visual Studio licenses. 
* **Artifact Management:** Assess storage needs for packages, as this might influence licensing decisions.

**Pricing Resources**

* **Azure DevOps:** Refer to the latest pricing page [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/devops/azure-devops-services/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/devops/azure-devops-services/)
* **GitHub:** Visit the pricing page for up-to-date information [https://github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing)

**Key Points**

* Your license management strategy must evolve alongside your DevOps adoption.
* Consider user needs, desired build speeds, and artifact storage requirements.
* Regularly review pricing pages for Azure DevOps and GitHub to stay informed.
